Description:  
------------

Living City is the name of our App based on the iOS platform. We explore the idea of the always changing cities in Europe. We live in a fast paced World and our cities are constantly on transition, new Buildings emerging, some older ones get renovated.

An element that we wanted to play with in the App was the concept of how the people in the city can contribute to the experience of living in Europe by giving input of bad areas of the city or even feedback about the new Spaces build by the government. Users can also give proposals about what kind of buildings or services should be build in certain areas of the city.

The App has a Map where you can see pins that represent locations of the city were the government has build or is building something. Proposals or recommendations from users or even complaints.

In the "community" area you can see a list of the most voted Proposals or Complaints from other users. You also get the chance to let your voice be heard and upload your own proposal or complaint.

Our goal is to engage the people with their cities and let their proposals and complaints be heard. Doing so, we can get the not only the government to pay attention to how citizens see and perceive their cities but we can also start to develop a feeling of responsibility and belonging of our urban environments in europe.
